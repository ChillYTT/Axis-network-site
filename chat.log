thats sick! the only main issue I'm seeing is the cutoff at the bottom of the page... is there a way to fix that?

that is a beta of what i will do, basicly i will make it onto this site.

alright. I fixed the problem with the cutoff. second thing is just the part where it says the main link. can we get rid of that or not? Y'know? that white bar at the top?

I am working on it
